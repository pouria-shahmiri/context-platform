## 🧠 Introduction

**Context Platform** is a specialized IDE for thought. It transforms the way you solve complex problems by combining the **Pyramid Principle** with **Generative AI**. Instead of staring at a blank page, you build structured logic trees, define product requirements, and map out technical architectures—all with Claude AI as your pair thinker.

It is designed for:
*   **Product Managers** defining scope and requirements.
*   **Architects** planning system components and data flows.
*   **Engineers** breaking down technical tasks.
*   **Founders** organizing business strategy.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Thinking Pyramids** | Break down broad problems into specific, actionable questions using a visual tree structure. |
| **AI Co-Pilot** | Integrated **Claude AI** helps generate sub-questions, answers, and summaries at every level of your thinking process. |
| **Product Specs** | Dedicated editors for defining **Product Definitions**, scope, risks, and success metrics. |
| **Architecture** | Visual tools for mapping **Technical Architectures** and **UI/UX Flows**. |
| **Context Awareness** | Upload documents and define a "Global Context" so the AI understands your specific project domain. |
| **Real-Time Sync** | Built on **Firebase**, enabling seamless synchronization across devices and users. |

## � Methodology

The platform is built around the **Pyramid Principle**:

1.  **Start with the Core Question**: What are you trying to solve?
2.  **Group & Summarize**: Group related insights and summarize them upwards.
3.  **MECE**: Ensure your breakdown is *Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive*.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (v16+)
*   **Firebase Account** (for backend)
*   **Anthropic API Key** (for AI features)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/context-platform.git
    cd context-platform
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    
    Update `.env` with your credentials:
    ```properties
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
    # ... other firebase config
    ```

4.  **Run Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.
